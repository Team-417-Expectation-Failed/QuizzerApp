# Sprint 2 Retrospective

[Retrospective board](https://edu.flinga.fi/s/E36DRNZ)


Successes:

- Everyone has a positive attitude towards the project
- Progress was good in the beginning of the sprint
- We learned a lot during the sprint

Issues:

- We didn't manage to finish all the user stories assigned for the sprint
- Some tasks caused bottle necks 
- Members of the team didn't have enough time for the project
- We felt we need even more clarity on the tasks on the spint backlog

Actions:

- We agreed that we will ask for help if we get stuck
- We're trying if numbering the user stories and related task helps to clarify the backlog
